          Hello, I&#39;m Jackson ðŸ‘‹ I&#39;ve recently graduated from the University of
          Bristol, where I achieved a first class Master&#39;s in Computer Science.
          Currently, I&#39;m particularly interested in
          <span className="font-semibold"> front-end work</span> and
          <span className="font-semibold"> games development</span>,
          having distinct experience from working on{" "}

          in these area during my degree and in my own time. I&#39;m incredibly
          motivated by work which I&#39;m interested in, and would love to work on
          projects which I can be passionate about. When I&#39;m not working on my
          own projects, I love playing video games, reviewing film and TV, and
          working out. Some of my favourites can be found{" "}
